# DO LIST
Simple to-do list desktop app build using electron

### Requirements:
- Creating a task should take very little effort
- Tasks should small and self contained (< 1 day)
- No deadlines, only priorities

This is not a replacement for project management software or software development tracking. 

The purpose is to keep track of all the various **tasks** that come up throughout your day. There are many sources for these tasks (email, jira, meetings, etc). I wanted a place to view/prioritize/manage these tasks that was simple but better than a text file.

## Build
```npm run release```
