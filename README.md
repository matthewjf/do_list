# DO LIST
Simple to-do list desktop app build using electron

### Goals:
- Creating a task should take very little effort
- Tasks should small and self contained (< 1 day)
- No deadlines, only priorities

This is not a replacement for project management software or software development tracking. It's to keep track of all the various *things* that come up throughout the day. Some of them may have a corresponding story in your company-wide tracking software, but could also be a simple task to send an email.

## Build
```npm run release```
